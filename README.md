# SQL-DATA-WAREHOUSE-PROJECT-
Building a modern data warehouse with SQL Server, including ETL processes, data modelling, and analytics. This work showcase the first Warehouse I built while developing my Data Engineering skills.

The data generated in the gold layer of the medallion archetecture would be used in developing communicating insights using powerBI and at some stage automated powerpoint presentation.
